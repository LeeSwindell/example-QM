# Quantum Mechanics Labs 
These were the labs from 'Applications of Quantum Mechanics,' a course I took at Cornell. This was my first introduction to programming. For the most part, these labs were about taking knowledge I already had and converting it into a useful format for computing. The challenge was figuring out how to model problems that I understood on paper into a numerical method that could be used to calculate and simulate problems that stubbornly reject closed-form solutions.
